## About me

### Background

As a child in Jamaica, I was attracted to any piece of technology I could get my hands on. The best days
of the week for me was the weekend when I could see my cousin to play Pokemon with him, have my friend
bring over a PS2 game for me to play on after I had begged my dad to send me a game from America and
eventually my own gameboy when my mom had the chance to travel to America. I quickly grew fascinated to
the amount that these small devices could do and did not hesitate when I got to America to discover as
much as I could about them. Overtime as I could afford more devices I started taking apart my 2DS,
Nintendo Switch, PC and more. I didn't know what I wanted to do as a career yet but I was sure it would
be something hands on with technology

### Why do I code?

At first I played around with the idea of a doctor or a lawyer to please my parents but they never felt
right. When I started thinking more of what I wanted to do, I stumbled across [Python for everybody](https://www.py4e.com), a free resource by 
[Professor Charles Severance](https://www.dr-chuck.com "Link to Professor Severance's personal page") who
for me broke the complexity of coding/programming. Writing code has quickly become the most rewarding
experience of my life and is something I do more for myself than anything else 

### Why hire me?

As someone truly passionate about what they do, I will always put my all to make sure that I do an
amazing job and go above and become what is expected of me. I come with a promise of excellence since I
don't know how to do anything less. I am always willing to adjust and improve my work to grow as a
developer/programmer

### Notion Notes

I've pushed myself to learn how to code for almost half a year now and I am very proud of my progress.

how dedicated I am to learning my craft
